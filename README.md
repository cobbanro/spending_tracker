Spending Tracker
Build an app that allows a user to track their spending.

MVP
The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail
The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport
The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.
The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.

To run application:

1. 'ruby controller.rb' in terminal
2. Then in web browser, type 'http://localhost:4567/transactions/index'
